The bridge's two towers are 306 meters (1,004 ft) tall and the fifth tallest in the world. The total required length is 8,206 meters (26,923 ft). Construction began in June 2003 and was required to be connected by June 2007. The bridge was opened to traffic on May 25, 2008, and officially opened on June 30, 2008. Costs of construction are Estimated at US$1.7 Billion. The completed shaft of the bridge shortens the travel time between Shanghai and Nantong, formerly four hours away, to one hour. [6] It brought Nantong one step closer to becoming an important part of the Yangtze River Delta economic region, and has attracted more foreign investors to the city. ",
        "p6":"The bridge also played a pivotal role in the development of the poor areas of northern Jiangsu. The tower is an inverted Y-shaped reinforced concrete structure, with a connection between its legs. The deck is a girder steel box with internal transverse and longitudinal compartments and ramps on both sides of the deck. The total width of the bridge deck is 41 meters including the bridgehead. Construction of the Zhaodian-Huangdu Section of the Nantong-Shanghai Railway was started in March 2014. After the completion of the foundation, the bridge lay main track, and “communication, signaling, energy and electrification” works, transport operation and integrated testing began on April 20, 2020.",
        "p8":"The total construction cost of Sutong Bridge is estimated at 6.45 billion USD (750 million USD). $2.2 billion ($266.12 million), 35% of the total, was collected by the local governments of Jiangsu Province (60%), Suzhou City and Nantong City (each city) ) 20%). The remaining amount is raised through loans from domestic banks. The bridge is being tolled and the fare received is being used to repay the loans.",

        "p9":"The Yangtze River Bridge is a highway bridge with a straight line, so you should drive sensibly according to the relevant regulations and just go all the way with your favorite music.",
        "p10":"Best time to travel: Sutong Bridge is open all year round and is not affected by the seasonal climate so you can choose your season to visit. However, I would like to remind you that the holidays have a lot of people floating, so the traffic jam on the bridge is very serious, and can last for tens of minutes or even just a few hours. Therefore, we should do our best to avoid holidays, choose working days or avoid the daily rush hour traffic."
