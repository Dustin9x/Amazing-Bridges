WELCOME TO OUR PROJECT

A bridge is a structure built to connect two places without blocking the road below it. A bridge can be built over a road, body of water, or valley.
Bridges are made of different materials and have different designs. Bridges can be classified according to the weight holding mechanism, the materials used and the style, and other parameters. The most commonly used classification method is their weight capacity.Some common bridge types include arch bridges, girder bridges, truss bridges, suspension bridges, and cantilever bridges.

The Amazing Bridges will show you the other aspect, which rank all the famous bridge in the world to type of: longest, tallest, and oldest, most visited, etc.
