FUNCTIONS OF THE WEB

The Website is to be created based on the following requirements:

The Home Page should be created with proper sections, graphic and logo.

A Menu should be created which would categorize all the information about the features provided in the site.

Filter/Search bar should be provided to user to select products, brands as desired.

The information should be categorized according to the Brand names of Mobiles like if a User want to see only Apple phones the he click on Apple button and he will see only that Brand phones and so on.

A brief summary of features of Individual Phones should be displayd on the site along with the Cell phone but detailed features should be stored in Individual Word documents which can be downloaded or viewed by the User who wishes to see the same.

A comparison module should also be there where there is Phone Comparisons done with various models of same brands or various models of various brands.

When a particular brand phones are being displayed the background image of the web page should show the logo of that brand.
